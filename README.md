# Task 4 – Optimization Model

## Problem Statement
Maximize profit for a factory producing two products using Linear Programming.

## Tools Used
- Python
- PuLP (Linear Programming Library)

## Objective Function
Maximize:
Profit = 40 × Product A + 30 × Product B

## Constraints
- Product A ≤ 40
- Product B ≤ 30
- Product A + Product B ≤ 60

## Solution
The optimization model finds the best production quantities to achieve maximum profit.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of optimization techniques to solve real-world business problems.
